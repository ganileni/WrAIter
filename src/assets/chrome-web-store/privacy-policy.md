# Privacy Policy for WrAIter Chrome Extension

**Last Updated:** 2025-05-23

This Privacy Policy describes how the WrAIter Chrome Extension ("the Extension") operates concerning user data.

We understand the importance of your privacy. This Extension is designed to enhance your text editing experience without collecting personal data itself.

**1. Data Collection**

The WrAIter Chrome Extension **does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data** about its users. We do not track your browsing history, search queries, form data, device information, or any other personally identifiable information.

**2. Interaction with Third-Party AI Services**

The core functionality of the Extension involves sending text selected by the user, along with the user's query and optional context, to third-party Artificial Intelligence (AI) model providers (such as Google Gemini and OpenAI) via their respective APIs.

*   **Data Sent to AI APIs:** The only data sent to these APIs is the text you select on a webpage and the query/context you explicitly provide within the Extension's popup interface when you initiate a request for suggestions.
*   **Purpose:** This data is sent solely for the purpose of generating text suggestions based on your request.
*   **Your Responsibility:** You, the user, are entirely responsible for the content of the text you select and the query/context you provide. By using the Extension to send text to AI APIs, you acknowledge and agree that the processing of this text is subject to the privacy policies and terms of service of the respective AI model provider.
*   **AI Provider Privacy Policies:** We strongly encourage you to review the privacy policies of the AI model providers whose APIs you use through this Extension (e.g., Google's privacy policy for Gemini, OpenAI's privacy policy) to understand how they handle the data sent to their services.

**3. API Keys**

The Extension allows you to store API keys for third-party AI providers. These keys are stored locally within your Chrome browser's synced storage (`chrome.storage.sync`). They are used solely to authenticate your requests with the respective AI provider APIs and are never transmitted to the Extension developers or any other third party besides the AI provider you are using.

**4. Data Security**

While the Extension does not collect your personal data, we implement standard security practices for handling API keys within Chrome's secure storage mechanism. However, the security of the data you choose to send to third-party AI APIs is the responsibility of those providers.

**5. User Rights**

Since the Extension does not collect or store any personal data, there are no user rights related to data access, correction, deletion, or opting out that apply directly to the Extension's operation itself. Your rights regarding the data processed by the AI APIs are governed by the policies of the respective AI providers.

**6. Changes to This Privacy Policy**

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page and updating the "Last Updated" date.

**7. Contact Us**

If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, please contact us through the support channels provided on the Extension's listing page or website (if applicable).
